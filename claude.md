## Key Decisions & Context

### User Background
- Product manager at a company using Vercel/Sanity.io/Next.js stack
- Beginner coder (grasps concepts, learning syntax)
- Wants to learn through hands-on development
- Updates portfolio only a few times per year
- Not rushed - prioritizes quality over speed

### Content Strategy
- Starting with placeholder content
- Will migrate real content later
- CMS allows easy updates without code changes

### Theme Choice
- Dark theme selected (matches inspiration sites)
- No theme toggle initially (keep it simple)

## Development Workflow

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server runs at: http://localhost:3000

### Key Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

## Next Steps
1. Set up Sanity.io CMS (Phase 2)
2. Create content schemas for projects and about page
3. Build out homepage hero section
4. Implement first animations (parallax, scroll reveals)

## Notes & Learnings
- Project uses Next.js 16.0.1 with Turbopack enabled
- Git repository already initialized by create-next-app
- Using src/ directory for cleaner organization
- Tailwind v4 with new @import syntax in globals.css

## Questions/Decisions Pending
- [ ] Sanity Studio: Embedded in Next.js app or separate deployment?
- [ ] Project detail pages: Dynamic routes or static pages?
- [ ] Analytics: Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics, or none?
- [ ] Contact form: Simple email link, form with backend, or third-party service?
